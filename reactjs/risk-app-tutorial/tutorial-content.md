We are going to build the initial prototype by using setState only. In a later stage we will re-factor to use a more robust and flaxible state management solution. This approach is usefull as it makes you face the reason why you want to complicate (apparently) your life by using redux.

## Who should read this tutorial
The tutorial is suited for beginner react developer that have already a basic (even if very basic) knowledge of react.
I always found hard to find good tutorial in between a complete beginner and a more advanced use case. This tuturial tries to fill this gap.

## Road map
The tutorial will be published in episode.
in each episode, we will try to details all the steps required.
The approach is to introduce as little concept at the time as possible.
In some cases, we will use the most straith forward solution and then refactor for more "smart" approach.

## Environemt setup

### IDE - code editor
I personally use Atom to code with react. Atom is a good editor. Below I'll provide my Atom configuration. 
Most of modern IDE will be good, that's really your preference. In many cases you will be able to find also similar plugin.
My Atom packages list:
  - atom-ternjs
